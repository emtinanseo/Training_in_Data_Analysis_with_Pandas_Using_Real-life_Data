    "# Comparing Data From Different Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of exercises we will attempt overlaying data from two sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. keybiotopes_habitatgroups_shapefiles:\n",
    "    - These shapefiles are the result of the last set of exercises analysing sksNyckelBiotoper_shapefiles. Both shapefiles display the locations and attributes of the key biotopes (Nyckelbiotoper) in Sweden.\n",
    "    - Key-biotopes are high conservation value forests mapped by The Swedish Forest Agency though field surveys. A database of approximately 67Â 000 areas, consisting of polygons. A polygon represents an area that was determined to have high conservation value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. rutor_shapefiles:\n",
    "    - This folder contains shapefiles for a specific (square-shaped) area in Sweden, for which laser measurements and satellite data are available.\n",
    "    - The laser measurements are made using Lidar (light detection and ranging), an optical remote-sensing technique that uses laser light to densely sample the surface of the earth, producing highly accurate x, y, z measurements.\n",
    "    - Lidar measurements are stored in `.laz` files. These files exist separately, but their names are registered in rutor_shape_files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal is to use laser data (referenced in rutor_shapefiles) to study and identify key-biotopes (registered in sksNyckelBiotoper_shapefiles). So in this set of exercises we will find the intersection of these two datasets and study it."
