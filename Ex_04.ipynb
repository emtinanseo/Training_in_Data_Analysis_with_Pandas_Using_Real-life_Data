    "## Our Proposal\n",
    "We choose to divide key-biotopes by the types of habitats they contain. Then run a simple learning algorithm on Laser data (stored in `.laz` files) and see whether we can distinguish areas with that include particular Key-Biotopes from others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method:\n",
    "Laser measurements are available for square areas, 2.5 km X 2.5 km. To facilitate analysis, we will do it in steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Divide these squares into smaller squares of equal areas (called henceforth tiles)\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Compute the percentage of area within a tile which is occupied by key-biotopes. Then, according to these percentages, label tiles for whether they contain key-bishops or not, i.e. a positive set and a negative set.\n",
    "- **Step 3:** From the laser data, compute a set of variables that characterize each tile.\n",
    "- **Step 4:** Apply a classification algorithm on the resulting dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "In the last set of exercises you have went through step 1 and most step 2. You have produced shapefiles of tiles, describing their location, ratio of their area occupied by key-biotopes (coniferous forests) and referencing `.laz` files that contain the laser measurement.\n",
    "In this set of exercises you will first choose a dataset, a subset of tiles. Then you will load the corresponding `.laz` files and summerize the data in each to a handful of variables."

    "### Lidar\n",
    "Lidar (light detection and ranging) is an optical remote-sensing technique. It is a method to determine ranges (variable distance) by targeting an object with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver.\n",
    "Lidar is used primarily in airborne laser mapping to densely sample the surface of the earth, producing highly accurate x, y, z measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each laser pulse, several attributes are recorded in addition to x, y and z values. This additional information includes\n",
    "- intensity: the return strength of the laser pulse,\n",
    "- return number & number of returns: an emitted laser pulse can have up to 5 returns depending on the reflecting surface,\n",
    "- point classification value: a classification defines the type of object which reflected the laser pulse. Lidar points can be classified into a number of categories including bare earth or ground, top of canopy, and water. Different classes are defined by integer codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LAS and LAZ Files\n",
    "Lidar produces mass point cloud datasets which are stored in `.las` files or their compressed version `.laz` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "A LAS file contains a number of fields for each point in the lidar point cloud. Those fields (or dimensions) include coordinates X, Y and Z, intensity, return_number, number_of_returns, scan_direction_flag, edge_of_flight_line, classification, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A LAS file also has a header. It contains metadata about the file, including information about the coordinating reference system (CRS), range of elevation, scale and offset of coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "See for more about [Lidar](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/las-dataset/what-is-lidar-.htm)\n",

    "## 3.2 Summarize LAZ Files?\n",
    "LAZ files store millions of points, each with multiple attributes, that cover some surface area. We want to boil this huge amount of data down to a few variables that can meaningfully characterize the area in question. However, there is no clear way to do this. We don't know which variables could fulfill this purpose, how many variables should we search for? It might even be impossible to get a summary this way.\n",
