    "We choose to divide key-biotopes by the types of habitats they contain. Then run a simple learning algorithm on Laser data (stored in `.laz` files) and see whether we can distinguish areas with that include particular Key-Biotopes from others.\n",

    "Laser measurements are available for square areas, 2.5 km X 2.5 km. To facilitate analysis, we will do it in steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Divide these squares into smaller squares of equal areas (called henceforth tiles)\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Compute the percentage of area within a tile which is occupied by key-biotopes. Then, according to these percentages, label tiles for whether they contain key-bishops or not, i.e. a positive set and a negative set.\n",
    "- **Step 3:** From the laser data, compute a set of variables that characterize each tile.\n",
    "- **Step 4:** Apply a classification algorithm on the resulting dataset."
