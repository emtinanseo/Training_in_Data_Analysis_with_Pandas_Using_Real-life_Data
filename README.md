Abstract: This set of exercises carries out analysis in Pandas and GeoPandas of arrays of data relating to Swedish forests. It is meant to train mathematics students in handling real-life data. Minimal knowledge of Python and basic statistics is needed to understand the Pandas operations. This educational material is produced as a follow-up activity inspired by the problem proposed by the Swedish Forest Agency (https://www.skogsstyrelsen.se/en/) to the “Mathematics with Industry Day” (MiMM Day) that took place at Karlstad University, Karlstad, Sweden on December 15, 2020 (https://www.kau.se/MIMM-day). The work was financially supported by the Jobbsprånget internship program by the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (https://www.iva.se/en/).
